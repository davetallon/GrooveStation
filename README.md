# GrooveStation

GrooveStation is a music player application built using C#. It allows users to load and play local music files, navigate through the playlist, control playback, adjust volume, and more.

The GrooveStation application follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern. The Presenter layer acts as the intermediary between the Model and View layers, handling user interactions and updating the View based on changes in the Model. This architecture allows for easier testing, modularity, and separation of concerns, making the GrooveStation application more robust and maintainable.
